# Turbine JS Func

[Turbine JS](https://docs.meroxa.com/turbine/get-started) is a data application framework for building server-side applications that are event-driven, respond to data in real-time, and scale using cloud-native best practices.

This package contains the gRPC server used to power Turbine JS functions on the Meroxa platform. It uses a small wrapper that executes a function with a set of records just as a user has defined it in a Turbine JS app.
Please see [the Turbine JS repo](https://github.com/meroxa/turbine-js) for more information.
